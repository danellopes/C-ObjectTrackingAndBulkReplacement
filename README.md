### Example of the <Described Design Pattern>

This example of the faceted builder design pattern was develop using C# language.

Using this technique it’s possible to keep a reference or copy of all of objects created by the factory, getting a list of all objects created or making a bulk replacement of all objects at once. This is more effective when using a reference instead of a copy, since changing a copy won’t automatically change all locations where the original objects is being used.
